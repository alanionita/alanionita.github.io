# Portfolio rewrite

## Background

My old [portfolio](https://github.com/alanionita/alanionita.github.io) written is NextJS is getting old. 

I'm happy in general with NextJS for production apps, and in particular very happy with their statically generated bundles. 

With SvelteKit I'm looking for a project that is closer to Web APIs and vanilla Javascript.

## Intentions

- Like for like replacement
- Reproducing /blog features
- Reproducing the same designs
- Benchmarking the start, build, install, and runtime for both stacks
